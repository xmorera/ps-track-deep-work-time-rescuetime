| 1 | ~~Being Busy Does Not Equal Productive: RescueTime Saves the Day~~ Track Deep Work Time with RescueTime  **Module Description:**  Years ago, Xavier had a boss who always responded to “How are you doing?” with, “Busy, busy, busy\!”—sometimes even adding “like a bee.” Xavier didn’t love that answer… and years later, he realized he’d become that same person: always busy, but not always effective and productive. Despite working long hours across many different things, Xavier felt like he wasn't making real progress. So he started to reflect and ask: "How can I get more stuff done?" Then it hit him. It’s not about the amount of time worked—what really matters is focusing on the right things. The work that moves the needle. What productivity experts call "deep work." And as they say: what doesn't get measured, can't be improved. That’s when he discovered RescueTime—a tool that could show him exactly how much time he was spending in real deep work, not just reacting to distractions. In this course, I walk through how Xavier sets a daily focus goal in RescueTime, then show his weekly analytics dashboard. We interpret the data—what apps are helping or hurting his focus—and then make calendar adjustments to protect more deep work time. Along the way, I highlight common traps like mislabeling tasks or overestimating focus. The course wraps up with a simple challenge: spend one week tracking your deep work. Then adjust just one thing—and see how much more impact you can make. Potential Demos: (may change when I sit down to plan and record) **Set a Focus Time Goal** Demonstrate how to define daily/weekly focus hour targets in RescueTime. **Review the Productivity Pulse** Walk through the dashboard that visualizes overall productivity trends and time in deep work. **Analyze the Focus Work Report** Show how RescueTime categorizes activities and quantifies time spent in high-focus vs. distracted states. **Identify Distractions by Category** Explore how to view which applications and websites are eating into focus time. **Use the Timeline View to Spot Fragmentation** Examine a day’s timeline to pinpoint multitasking or attention shifts. **Customize Activity Categories** Reassign or refine app/website labels to more accurately reflect real work vs. distraction. **Adjust Calendar Based on Insights** Use findings to shift or block out more time for deep work based on actual data. **Enable Focus Sessions**   Show how to activate RescueTime’s Focus Session feature to block distractions in real time.  | 5 *min* |
