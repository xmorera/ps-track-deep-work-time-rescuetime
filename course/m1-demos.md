## Demo 1 – Set Your Daily Focus Goal (Core)
**Purpose:** Introduce RescueTime and anchor success to a measurable Focus Work target.  
**Learner Goal:** Can locate and set/adjust Daily Focus Work goal.  
**Prerequisites:** Logged into RescueTime web app; any plan with Focus Work goal feature.  
**Estimated Time (recorded):** 0:40–0:50  
**Assets to Prepare:** Dashboard (early in day so progress bar is mostly empty).  
**Pitfalls to Mention (briefly):** Free/legacy plan may hide goal; reassure keeping default is fine.  

### Steps
1. Navigate to settings: Click avatar (top-right) → Account Settings (or Work Settings).  
   Narration: "Let’s set the number that defines a successful focus day."  
2. Locate Daily Focus Goal field (e.g., shows 2h 30m).  
   Narration: "RescueTime gives you a starting target—adjust it to something realistic you can hit most days."  
3. Change to new value (e.g., 3h) → Save/Update.  
   Narration: "I’ll set mine to 3 hours—ambitious but achievable."  
4. Return to dashboard. Hover the Focus Work progress bar showing 0 / 3h (or current partial).  
   Narration: "This bar is the scoreboard for deep work today—much more meaningful than raw hours online."  

### Outcome
Goal updated; progress meter recalculated; learner sees tangible metric to pursue.

## Demo 2 – Read Your Core Metrics (Dashboard Scan) (Core)
**Purpose:** Teach a 10–15 second daily interpretation loop.  
**Learner Goal:** Can interpret Productivity Pulse, Focus Work vs goal, Top Activities.  
**Prerequisites:** At least ~2 hours of mixed tracked activity.  
**Estimated Time:** 0:55–1:05  
**Assets:** Dashboard with visible Pulse, Focus Work module, Top Activities/Categories.  
**Pitfalls:** Avoid explaining Pulse formula; skip exhaustive list reading.  

### Steps
1. Open Dashboard (Home).  
   Narration: "Start with a quick scan—three elements tell you nearly everything."  
2. Point to Productivity Pulse (e.g., 72). Hover to reveal contributing categories.  
   Narration: "Pulse is an at-a-glance productivity score—higher means more time in productive activities."  
3. Show Focus Work module: e.g., "1h 10m of 3h goal (39%)."  
   Narration: "I’m under halfway—so next block should be protected focus, not inbox triage."  
4. Scroll to / highlight Top Activities or Categories: e.g., Code Editor (Very Productive), Email (Neutral), Social Media (Distracting).  
   Narration: "One distracting slice already—flagged for later reduction."  
5. Summarize verbally.  
   Narration: "Scan, interpret, decide next move—done in under 15 seconds."  

### Outcome
Learner understands a fast interpret → decide loop instead of passive data viewing.

## Demo 3 – Spot Distractions & Fix a Misclassified Item (Optional)
**Purpose:** Ensure data accuracy and highlight distraction visibility.  
**Learner Goal:** Can identify top distraction and correct a miscategorized activity.  
**Prerequisites:** At least one distracting site/app plus one misclassified neutral item.  
**Estimated Time:** 0:45–0:55  
**Assets:** Activities (or Categories) report with sample misclassification.  
**Pitfalls:** Do not show sensitive internal URLs; keep reclassification fast.  

### Steps
1. Go to Reports → Activities (timeframe: Today).  
   Narration: "Reports surface where attention leaked."  
2. Point at a distracting entry (e.g., Twitter – 22m).  
   Narration: "This is a clear distraction chunk."  
3. Click a misclassified productive internal tool currently Neutral.  
4. Choose Edit / Reclassify → assign correct category (e.g., Design Tool → Very Productive) → Save.  
5. Briefly show updated color/status.  
   Narration: "Accurate labels = trustworthy metrics—30 seconds of cleanup early on pays off."  

### Outcome
Display changes; reinforces that classification is foundational to actionable insights.

## Demo 4 – Plan & Protect a Deep Work Block (Data → Calendar) (Core)
**Purpose:** Convert insight into a concrete schedule change.  
**Learner Goal:** Can pick optimal window and calendar‑block deep work.  
**Prerequisites:** Several days of data; visible pattern (e.g., strong mornings).  
**Estimated Time:** 1:00–1:10  
**Assets:** Focus Work hourly heatmap or trend; calendar (real or staged).  
**Pitfalls:** Avoid vague block names; ensure block shows Busy.  

### Steps
1. Open Reports → Focus Work (or Trends) for last 7 days; show hourly distribution / heatmap.  
   Narration: "Pattern: deepest focus consistently appears mid‑morning."  
2. Verbally summarize fragmentation elsewhere (e.g., afternoons).  
3. Switch to next week’s calendar.  
4. Create event: "Focus Block – Project X" (e.g., 09:00–10:30). Set Busy; add description: "Goal: Draft module outline—no meetings, no chat."  
5. (Optional) Add notification or note: "Start RescueTime Focus Session."  
   Narration: "Protecting the slot turns intention into commitment."  

### Outcome
A defended calendar block anchored in actual data; learner sees data → decision → protection loop.

## Demo 5 – Run a Focus Session (Optional Booster)
**Purpose:** Demonstrate active distraction blocking during a focus period.  
**Learner Goal:** Can start a Focus Session and understand its enforcement value.  
**Prerequisites:** Plan tier with Focus Sessions; at least one distracting site to test.  
**Estimated Time:** 0:50–0:55  
**Assets:** Dashboard; list of a few distracting URLs.  
**Pitfalls:** Don’t spend time cycling multiple blocks—one example suffices.  

### Steps
1. From Dashboard, click the Focus Session (bullseye) button.  
2. Set duration (e.g., 60m) + optional note ("Finish data model"). Start.  
3. Show session overlay / countdown.  
4. Attempt to open a known distracting site → show blocked page.  
   Narration: "Automatic guardrail—removing friction from staying on task."  
5. Cut to session end summary (or simulate early end): display focus time logged + distractions blocked.  
   Narration: "Use sessions when willpower dips or stakes are high."  

### Outcome
Viewer understands enforcement mechanism; sees blocked distraction and summary metrics.

## Demo 6 – Weekly Review & One Adjustment Challenge (Core)
**Purpose:** Reinforce habit loop and provide a simple, sustainable improvement path.  
**Learner Goal:** Can extract baseline weekly metrics and choose a single adjustment.  
**Prerequisites:** 5–7 days of data (or staged Week 1 screenshot) with mixed performance.  
**Estimated Time:** 0:45–0:55  
**Assets:** Weekly summary visuals (Focus Work total/avg, Pulse, Top Distractions). Simple loop graphic (Measure → Insight → Adjust → Improve).  
**Pitfalls:** Avoid promising unrealistic leaps; emphasize iteration.  

### Steps
1. Open Weekly Summary (Reports → Productivity / Focus Work).  
   Narration: "Week 1 baseline: Avg Focus Work 1h 35m (Goal 3h), Pulse 68, Top distraction: Social Media 1h 02m."  
2. Display/write these three numbers (on-screen annotation).  
3. Identify leverage point: e.g., mornings strong but only one protected block.  
4. Choose ONE adjustment (e.g., "Add second 45m morning block Tue/Thu"). Annotate.  
5. Show loop graphic.  
   Narration: "One change per week compounds. Next week we re-measure and iterate."  
6. Issue challenge: "Capture your baseline today—revisit in 7 days."  

### Outcome
Learner leaves with concrete baseline + single improvement experiment (not overwhelmed by multiple changes).
