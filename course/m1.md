***(Pluralsight Tech Tip)***

<!-- 
Let me ask you a question and I want you to be honest.

[LIVEVIDEO]
Do you FEEL like you are always BUSY but at the end of the day you didn't achieve much YET you are still exhausted?

This is the ‚Äúbusy but not productive‚Äù trap.

# Deep Work  
Long, focused work on important tasks  
(often pushed aside)

<!-- 
That's because the real progress comes from **deep work**: those high-impact tasks that need uninterrupted focus.

<!--
Unfortunately, deep work often gets sidelined by urgent shallow tasks and distractions.

How do you FIX this?

<!-- 


The key 
:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}. It gives you a personal daily **Focus Work** goal ‚Äì essentially, a deep work target ‚Äì tailored to your role and schedule:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}. It also provides a **Productivity Pulse** score from 0 to 100 to gauge your overall productivity:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.

## Set Your Daily Focus Goal

1. **Access Settings:** In the RescueTime web app, go to **Account Settings > Work Settings**:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.
2. **Set Focus Work Goal:** Edit the ‚ÄúDaily focus goal‚Äù to your desired deep work hours (e.g. 2‚Äì3 hours):contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}.
3. **Track Progress:** A progress bar will fill as you log Focus Work time, showing when you hit your goal:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}.

<!-- 
Presenter Notes:
Start by setting a realistic daily **Focus Work** goal. RescueTime usually sets this for you during setup (often around 2‚Äì3 hours depending on your role:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}), but you can adjust it. In the web app, navigate to your account or work settings and find the daily focus goal setting:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}. Change it if needed ‚Äì maybe you aim for 3 hours of deep work. Once set, RescueTime‚Äôs assistant will display a progress bar that fills up as you do Focus Work:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}. This gives you real-time feedback and a little motivation boost as you approach your goal each day.

## Check Productivity & Focus Stats

- **Productivity Pulse:** View your daily score (0‚Äì100) ‚Äì higher means more time on productive tasks:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}. *(Hover or click to see what contributed to the score.)*
- **Focus Work Progress:** See how many hours of deep work you‚Äôve logged versus your goal (e.g. *2.5h out of 3h*):contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}.
- **Top Activities:** RescueTime lists where your time went by category (e.g. Design, Email) and highlights productive vs. distracting time:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}.

<!-- 
Presenter Notes:
Now let‚Äôs review our stats. On your RescueTime dashboard or reports, check the **Productivity Pulse** ‚Äì a quick score of your day‚Äôs productivity:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}. For example, a 75 pulse means you spent most of your day on productive tasks. Next, look at your **Focus Work** hours. RescueTime will show how much deep work you did and whether you met your goal (say, *2.5 hours of Focus Work out of a 3-hour goal*). You‚Äôll also see a breakdown of where your time went: your top activities and categories for the day:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}. This overview lets you gauge at a glance how focused (or distracted) your day really was.
-->

---

## Identify Your Distractions

1. **Review Categories:** Find the sections labeled *Distracting* or *Personal* in your reports. These show time spent on low-productivity activities (e.g. social media, news).
2. **Spot Time-Wasters:** Note which apps or sites ate up chunks of your day. RescueTime‚Äôs category breakdown makes these obvious:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}.
3. **Take Action:** Once you know your top distractions, you can set limits or be mindful to avoid them (RescueTime can even alert you or block them during focus periods:contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}).

<!-- 
Presenter Notes:
A key benefit of RescueTime is uncovering where your *attention leaks*. Check your dashboard or the Productivity report for categories marked as **Distracting** (or ‚ÄúPersonal‚Äù) ‚Äì these are your time-wasters. It might show, for example, that YouTube or Twitter consumed 1 hour today. Seeing this laid out can be eye-opening. Identify the top offenders: perhaps social media, news sites, or unnecessary meetings. Now you‚Äôre armed with this knowledge. You might decide to set an alert or limit for these activities, or simply be more conscious about avoiding them. RescueTime helps by making your distractions visible and even lets you block them when you need to focus:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}.

## Use the Timeline View ‚è±Ô∏è

- **Visualize Your Day:** Open the **Timeline** (or ‚ÄúDaily Details‚Äù) view to see your day mapped out as time blocks. Focus periods, meetings, breaks ‚Äì all laid out sequentially.
- **Highlight Deep Work:** Blocks of **Focus Work** stand out, so you can see when you had uninterrupted time versus when you were interrupted.
- **Calendar Integration:** If you connect your work calendar, meetings and scheduled Focus Sessions show up on the timeline too:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23} ‚Äì helping you spot open gaps for potential deep work.

<!-- 
Presenter Notes:
For a deeper analysis, use RescueTime‚Äôs **Timeline** view (sometimes part of the ‚ÄúTimesheets‚Äù or daily details page). This gives you a visual timeline of your workday. You‚Äôll see colored blocks representing your activities through the day ‚Äì for example, a solid block from 9‚Äì10 AM when you were coding (Focus Work), a gap at 10 AM when you had a meeting, etc. With calendar integration, your meetings are marked on this timeline, and even Focus Sessions you scheduled will appear:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}. It‚Äôs a great way to visually identify when you were in the zone and when you got pulled away. Maybe you notice you had a great focus block in the morning, but after lunch your time fragmented. These insights set the stage for our next step: planning better.
-->

## Plan Your Deep Work Blocks

- **Find Your Focus Windows:** Look at your RescueTime data for when you‚Äôre most productive or have long open slots. *(E.g. mornings might show consistent high focus.)*
- **Block the Time:** Proactively schedule calendar blocks for deep work during those windows ‚Äì treat them like important meetings **with yourself**.
- **Leverage Insights:** RescueTime can even suggest **Focus Zones** ‚Äì ideal deep work times based on your schedule:contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}. Use these prompts to start Focus Sessions or simply make that time distraction-free.
  
<!-- 
Presenter Notes:
Now that you know when and how you work best, it‚Äôs time to adjust your schedule. Identify your optimal focus windows. For many, late morning or early afternoon might be golden focus time, or maybe right after you clear your inbox. RescueTime‚Äôs data (and its **Focus Zone** suggestions) will highlight these opportunities:contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}. Once you‚Äôve spotted a good window ‚Äì say 9‚Äì10:30 AM when you usually have no meetings and high productivity ‚Äì **block it off on your calendar**. Literally schedule an event for ‚ÄúFocus Time‚Äù so colleagues know you‚Äôre busy. Treat it like a meeting you can‚Äôt miss. By protecting this time, you‚Äôll consistently get deep work done instead of letting that time fill up with random tasks or meetings.

## (Optional) Start a Focus Session

- **Launch a Session:** Click the Focus Session button (the bullseye üéØ) in RescueTime to begin a timed focus period:contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}. Choose how long to focus (e.g. 30 or 60 minutes).
- **Block Distractions:** During a Focus Session, RescueTime **blocks distracting sites/apps** (social media, etc.) so you can‚Äôt stray:contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}:contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}.
- **Session Summary:** After time‚Äôs up, see a report ‚Äì how much Focus Work you logged, how many distractions were blocked, and your current focus streak:contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}.

<!-- 
Presenter Notes:
For an extra boost, try RescueTime‚Äôs **Focus Sessions**. This is like engaging ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù mode on steroids. To start one, hit the bullseye icon in the app‚Äôs interface:contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}, set a duration (maybe 60 minutes), and begin. RescueTime will **block distracting websites and apps** for the duration of the session:contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32} ‚Äì so if you absentmindedly try to open Facebook or a news site, it will stop you:contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}. It‚Äôs a powerful way to enforce the focus: no sneaking off to check social media. When the session ends, you‚Äôll get a little summary: how much focused time you achieved relative to your goal, how many distractions were blocked, and even a streak count if you do this daily:contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}. It‚Äôs optional, but if you struggle to stay on task, Focus Sessions can be a game-changer for deep work.

## Track a Week & Take Action üí°

- **Try it for One Week:** Use RescueTime throughout a work week and aim to hit your daily focus goal each day.
- **Review the Results:** At week‚Äôs end, check your Focus Work hours, Productivity Pulse, and top distractions for patterns.
- **Adjust One Thing:** Pick one change to improve your next week ‚Äì maybe schedule a new focus block, or eliminate a big distraction ‚Äì and build on that success.

<!-- 
Presenter Notes:
Now for your challenge: put this into practice for a week. Run RescueTime for a full workweek and really pay attention to your data. Did you consistently hit your focus time goal? What‚Äôs your average Productivity Pulse? What were your biggest distractions? After seven days, take a look at the trends. Then choose **one** adjustment to make. It could be blocking off an hour each day for deep work based on when you were most productive, or cutting down your social media time by using RescueTime‚Äôs blocking features. Small changes like these, informed by your own data, can have a big impact. Track your focus, make one tweak, and see how your productivity improves in the following week. Happy focusing!
